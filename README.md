# porganizer
This is a simple file creator script which creates files with a date prefix!

Currently it looks like as simple as is and I guess there are not many people out there who will need to run this script.
I am only using this to __save 3 seconds everyday__ to create a file with a date prefix when I'm writing my notes.

USAGE:

    python porganizer.py
    
It will create a file with the current date's prefix and a defaukt suffix; To customize the suffix, enter a suffix name as an input.

It can also be added to the environment variables to be used directly from the commandline.
